The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.\",\n",

One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\",\n",

Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.\",\n",

       "  {'context': \"The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name. The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.\",\n",

The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team has beaten an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center), which reopened for the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2014–15 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame, has achieved a 332-165 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where they advanced to the semifinals but were beaten by Penn State who went on and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During the 2014-15 season, the team went 32-6 and won the ACC conference tournament, later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion Duke Blue Devils twice during the season.

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads .    Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns .  Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured .   Types  Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails :   Transactional emails  Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts .  The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services .  Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) .   Direct emails  Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used .  Mobile email marketing Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy .   Comparison to traditional mail  There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail .   Advantages  Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons :    An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic .   Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing .   Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior .   Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital .   Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email .   Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates .   Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK .   If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses .    Disadvantages  As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % .  Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day .  Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy .   Opt - in email advertising  Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing .  Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements .  A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter .  With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments .   Legal requirements   Australia  The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) .   Canada  The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses .   European Union  In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses .  The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication .   United states  The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission .  In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages .  The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 .

Hermaphroditus Minor deity of unions , androgyny , marriage , sexuality and fertility Herculaneum fresco 1 - 50 AD , National Archaeological Museum , Naples . Abode Mount Ida Symbol Thyrsus , Kantharos Personal Information Consort Silenus , Maenad , Satyrs Parents Hermes and Aphrodite Siblings Eros / Cupid , Harmonia / Concordia , Phobos , Deimos , Pan , Priapus , Tyche In Greek mythology , Hermaphroditus or Hermaphroditos / hərˌmæf. rəˈdaɪ. təs / ( listen ) ( Ancient Greek : Ἑρμαφρόδιτος ) was the son of Aphrodite and Hermes . According to Ovid , he was born a remarkably handsome boy with whom the water nymph Salmacis fell in love and prayed to be united forever . A god , in answer to her prayer , merged their two forms into one and transformed them into an androgynous form . His name is compounded of his parents ' names , Hermes and Aphrodite . He was one of the Erotes . Because he was a son of Hermes , and consequently a great - grandson of Atlas , sometimes he is called Atlantiades ( Greek : Ατλαντιάδης ) . Hermaphroditus ' father , Hermes , was also called Atlantiades because his mother , Maia was the daughter of Atlas . His name is the basis for the word hermaphrodite . Hermaphroditus , the two - sexed child of Aphrodite and Hermes ( Venus and Mercury ) had long been a symbol of androgyny or effeminacy , and was portrayed in Greco - Roman art as a female figure with male genitals . Theophrastus 's account also suggests a link between Hermaphroditus and the institution of marriage . The reference to the fourth day of the month is telling : this is the luckiest day to have a wedding . Hermaphroditus 's association with marriage seems to have been that , by embodying both masculine and feminine qualities , he symbolized the coming together of men and women in sacred union . Another factor linking Hermaphroditus to weddings was his parents ' role in protecting and blessing brides . Hermaphroditus 's name is derived from those of his parents Hermes and Aphrodite . All three of these gods figure largely among erotic and fertility figures , and all possess distinctly sexual overtones . Sometimes , Hermaphroditus is referred to as Aphroditus . The phallic god Priapus was the son of Hermes by some accounts and the youthful god of desire Eros of Ares and Aphrodite . Mythology ( edit ) Further information : Salmacis and Salmacis ( fountain ) Ovid 's account relates that Hermaphroditus was nursed by naiads in the caves of Mount Ida , a sacred mountain in Phrygia ( present day Turkey ) . At the age of fifteen , he grew bored with his surroundings and traveled to the cities of Lycia and Caria . It was in the woods of Caria , near Halicarnassus ( modern Bodrum , Turkey ) that he encountered the nymph , Salmacis , in her pool . She was overcome by lust for the boy , who was very handsome but still young , and tried to seduce him , but was rejected . When he thought her to be gone , Hermaphroditus undressed and entered the waters of the empty pool . Salmacis sprang out from behind a tree and jumped into the pool . She wrapped herself around the boy , forcibly kissing him and touching his breast . While he struggled , she called out to the gods that they should never part . Her wish was granted , and their bodies blended into one form , `` a creature of both sexes '' . Hermaphroditus prayed to Hermes and Aphrodite that anyone else who bathed in the pool would be similarly transformed , and his wish was granted . `` In this form the story was certainly not ancient , '' Karl Kerenyi noted . He compared the myth of the beautiful ephebe with Narcissus and Hyacinthus , who had an archaic hero - cult , and Hymenaios . Diodorus Siculus in his work Library of History mention , that some say that Hermaphroditus is a god and appears at certain times among men , but there are some who declare that such creatures of two sexes are monstrosities , and coming rarely into the world as they do have the quality of presaging the future , sometimes for evil and sometimes for good . Cult and worship ( edit ) Main article : Aphroditus The oldest traces of the cult in Greek countries are found in Cyprus . Here , according to Macrobius ( Saturnalia , iii. 8 ) , there was a bearded statue of a male Aphrodite , called Aphroditos by Aristophanes . Philochorus in his Atthis ( ap . Macrobius loc . cit . ) further identified this divinity , at whose sacrifices men and women exchanged garments , with the Moon . A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC depicting Aphroditos was found in Perachora , which suggests it was an archaic cult . The deification and the origins of the cult of hermaphrodite beings stem from Eastern religions , where the hermaphrodite nature expressed the idea of a primitive being that united both genders . This double sex also attributed to Dionysus and Priapus - the union in one being of the two principles of generation and conception - denotes extensive fertilizing and productive powers . This Cyprian Aphrodite is the same as the later Hermaphroditos , which simply means Aphroditos in the form of a herm ( see Hermae ) , and first occurs in the Characters ( 16 ) of Theophrastus . After its introduction at Athens ( probably in the 5th century BC ) , the importance of this deity seems to have declined . It appears no longer as the object of a special cult , but limited to the homage of certain sects , expressed by superstitious rites of obscure significance . We find in Alciphron that there was at Athens a temple of Hermaphroditus . The passage proposes that he might be considered as the deity who presided over married people ; the strict union between husband and wife being aptly represented by a deity , who was male and female inseparably blended together . Literature ( edit ) The earliest mention of Hermaphroditus in Greek literature is by the philosopher Theophrastus ( 3rd century BC ) , in his book The Characters , XVI The Superstitious Man , in which he portrays various types of eccentric people . The first mention of Hermes and Aphrodite as Hermaphroditus 's parents was by the Greek historian , Diodorus Siculus ( 1st century BC ) , in his book Bibliotheca historica , book IV , 4.6. 5 . Hermaphroditus , as he has been called , who was born of Hermes and Aphrodite and received a name which is a combination of those of both his parents . Some say that this Hermaphroditus is a god and appears at certain times among men , and that he is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman , in that he has a body which is beautiful and delicate like that of a woman , but has the masculine quality and vigour of a man . But there are some who declare that such creatures of two sexes are monstrosities , and coming rarely into the world as they do they have the quality of presaging the future , sometimes for evil and sometimes for good . The only full narration of his myth is that of Ovid 's Metamorphoses , IV. 274 - 388 ( 8 AD ) , where the emphasis is on the feminine snares of the lascivious water - nymph Salmacis and her compromising of Hermaphroditus ' erstwhile budding manly strength , detailing his bashfulness and the engrafting of their bodies . A rendering of the story into an epyllion , published anonymously in 1602 , was later ( 1640 ) attributed by some to Francis Beaumont . In the Palatine Anthology , IX. 783 ( 980 AD ) , there is a reference to a sculpture of Hermaphroditus which was placed in a bath for both sexes . The passage IX. 317 is in dialogue form , based on the dialogue between Hermaphroditus and Silenus . The latter claims that he has had sexual intercourse with Hermaphroditus three times . Hermaphroditus complains and objects to the fact by invoking Hermes in an oath , while Silenus invokes Pan for the reliability of his allegations . Algernon Charles Swinburne 's poem `` Hermaphroditus '' in Poems and Ballads is subscribed Au Musée du Louvre , Mars 1863 , leaving no doubt that it was the Borghese Hermaphroditus that had inspired his ode .

Film ( edit ) A persona named ' Hermaphroditus ' appears in the film Fellini Satyricon as a childlike , physically weak god who is able to heal human supplicants afflicted by various ailments but apparently unable to heal him / herself . Hermaphroditus is not mentioned in the original Petronius novel Satyricon , on which Fellini 's film is loosely based . According to one source , the film episode `` may be based on a Pseudo-Petronian poem sometimes printed along with the Satyricon '' .

The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as a member club of the National League ( NL ) West division . Established in 1883 in Brooklyn , New York , the team moved to Los Angeles before the 1958 season . They played for four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in 1962 . The Dodgers as a franchise have won six World Series titles and 22 National League pennants. 11 NL MVP award winners have played for the Dodgers , winning a total of 13 MVP Awards , Eight Cy Young Award winners have pitched for the Dodgers , winning a total of twelve Cy Young Awards . The team has also produced 18 Rookie of the Year Award winners , twice as many as the next closest team , including four consecutive from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996 . In the early 20th century , the team , then known as the Robins , won league pennants in 1916 and 1920 , losing the World Series both times , first to Boston and then Cleveland . In the 1930s , the team changed its name to the Dodgers , named after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged the streetcars in the city . In 1941 , the Dodgers captured their third National League pennant , only to lose to the New York Yankees . This marked the onset of the Dodgers -- Yankees rivalry , as the Dodgers would face them in their next six World Series appearances . Led by Jackie Robinson , the first black Major League Baseball player of the modern era ; and three - time National League Most Valuable Player Roy Campanella , also signed out of the Negro Leagues , the Dodgers captured their first World Series title in 1955 by defeating the Yankees for the first time , a story notably described in the 1972 book The Boys of Summer . Following the 1957 season the team left Brooklyn . In just their second season in Los Angeles , the Dodgers won their second World Series title , beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959 . Spearheaded by the dominant pitching style of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale , the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles , sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963 , and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965 . The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees , and their first against them as a Los Angeles team . The Dodgers won four more pennants in 1966 , 1974 , 1977 and 1978 , but lost in each World Series appearance . They went on to win the World Series again in 1981 , thanks in part to pitching sensation Fernando Valenzuela . The early 1980s were affectionately dubbed `` Fernandomania . '' In 1988 , another pitching hero , Orel Hershiser , again led them to a World Series victory , aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time , by their injured star outfielder Kirk Gibson coming off the bench to pinch hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1 , in his only appearance of the series . The Dodgers share a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants , the oldest rivalry in baseball , dating back to when the two franchises played in New York City . Both teams moved west for the 1958 season . The Brooklyn Dodgers and Los Angeles Dodgers have collectively appeared in the World Series 19 times , while the New York Giants and San Francisco Giants have collectively appeared 20 times and have been invited 21 times . The Giants have won two more World Series ( 8 ) ; the Dodgers have won 22 National League pennants , while the Giants hold the record with 23 . Although the two franchises have enjoyed near equal success , the city rivalries are rather lopsided and in both cases , a team 's championships have predated to the other 's first one in that particular location . When the two teams were based in New York , the Giants won five World Series championships , and the Dodgers one . After the move to California , the Dodgers have won five in Los Angeles , the Giants have won three in San Francisco . Team history ( edit ) Brooklyn Dodgers ( edit ) Main article : History of the Brooklyn Dodgers The Dodgers were founded in 1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics , taking the name of a defunct team that had played in Brooklyn before them . The team joined the American Association in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the National League in 1890 . They promptly won the NL Championship their first year in the League . The team was known alternatively as the Bridegrooms , Grooms , Superbas , Robins , and Trolley Dodgers before officially becoming the Dodgers in the 1930s . In Brooklyn , the Dodgers won the NL pennant several times ( 1890 , 1899 , 1900 , 1916 , 1920 , 1941 , 1947 , 1949 , 1952 , 1953 , 1955 , 1956 ) and the World Series in 1955 . After moving to Los Angeles , the team won National League pennants in 1959 , 1963 , 1965 , 1966 , 1974 , 1977 , 1978 , 1981 , 1988 , and 2017 , with World Series championships in 1959 , 1963 , 1965 , 1981 and 1988 . In all , the Dodgers have appeared in 19 World Series : 9 in Brooklyn and 10 in Los Angeles . Jackie Robinson ( edit ) Main article : Jackie Robinson For most of the first half of the 20th century , no Major League Baseball team employed an African American player . Jackie Robinson became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major league game on April 15 , 1947 , as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers . This was mainly due to general manager Branch Rickey 's efforts . The deeply religious Rickey 's motivation appears to have been primarily moral , although business considerations were also a factor . Rickey was a member of The Methodist Church , the antecedent denomination to The United Methodist Church of today , which was a strong advocate for social justice and active later in the American Civil Rights Movement . This event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports in the United States , the concomitant demise of the Negro Leagues , and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights movement . Robinson was an exceptional player , a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity . He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award , which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor . The Dodgers ' willingness to integrate , when most other teams refused to , was a key factor in their 1947 -- 1956 success . They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson , three - time MVP Roy Campanella , Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe , Jim Gilliam and Joe Black . Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African - American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 . Move to Los Angeles ( edit ) Former Dodger greats who played in both Brooklyn and Los Angeles adorn the exterior of Dodger Stadium . Real estate businessman Walter O'Malley acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950 , when he bought the 25 percent share of co-owner Branch Rickey and became allied with the widow of the another equal partner , Mrs. John L. Smith . Before long , he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and better arrayed ballpark than Ebbets Field . Beloved as it was , Ebbets Field was no longer well - served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race , despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957 . O'Malley wanted to build a new , state of the art stadium in Brooklyn . But City Planner Robert Moses and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O'Malley's plans . To put pressure on the city , during the 1955 season , O'Malley announced that the team would play seven regular season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City 's Roosevelt Stadium in 1956 . Moses and the City considered this an empty threat , and did not believe O'Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City . After teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train , it became possible to include locations in the far west . Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to the Washington Senators to move to the West Coast . When O'Malley heard that LA was looking for a club , he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking . LA offered him what New York would not : a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark , and own that ballpark , giving him complete control over all revenue streams . When the news came out , NYC Mayor Robert F. Wagner , Jr. and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World 's Fair Grounds in Queens that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers . However , O'Malley was interested in his park only under his conditions , and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream . O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California , convincing Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep another team on the West Coast to ease approval of the moves . There was no turning back : the Dodgers were heading for Hollywood . The Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24 , 1957 , which the Dodgers won 2 -- 0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates . New York would remain a one - team town with the New York Yankees until 1962 , when Joan Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city . The blue background used by the Dodgers , would be adopted by the Mets , honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange . Los Angeles Dodgers ( edit ) Main article : History of the Los Angeles Dodgers The Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles . On April 18 , 1958 , the Dodgers played their first LA game , defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants , 6 -- 5 , before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . Catcher Roy Campanella , left partially paralyzed in an off - season accident , was never able to play in Los Angeles . The 1959 World Series was played partially at the LA Coliseum while Dodger Stadium was being built . Construction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962 . With its clean , simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees , the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle . O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house , achieving this by cantilevered grandstands that have since been widely imitated . More importantly for the team , the stadium 's spacious dimensions , along with other factors , gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching . Since moving to Los Angeles , the Dodgers have won 10 more National League Championships and five World Series rings .

In 1892 , the city of Brooklyn ( Brooklyn was an independent city until annexed by New York City in 1898 ) began replacing its slow - moving , horse - drawn trolley lines with the faster , more powerful electric trolley lines . Within less than three years , by the end of 1895 , electric trolley accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well over 500 people . Brooklyn 's high - profile , the significant number of widely reported accidents , and a trolley strike in early 1895 , combined to create a strong association in the public 's mind between Brooklyn and trolley dodging . Sportswriters started using the name `` trolley dodgers '' to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season . The name was shortened to , on occasion , the `` Brooklyn Dodgers '' as early as 1898 . Sportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the `` Bums '' , in reference to the team 's fans and possibly because of the `` street character '' nature of Jack Dawkins , the `` Artful Dodger '' in Charles Dickens ' Oliver Twist . Newspaper cartoonist Willard Mullin used a drawing of famous clown Emmett Kelly to depict `` Dem Bums '' : the team would later use `` Weary Willie '' in promotional images , and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s . Other team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics , Grays , Grooms , Bridegrooms , Superbas and Robins . All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team , but not in any official capacity . The team 's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club . However , the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period , simultaneously with these other nicknames , by fans and sportswriters of the day . The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932 , when the word `` Dodgers '' appeared on team jerseys . The `` conclusive shift '' came in 1933 , when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name `` Dodgers '' . Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932 . A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out : `` Jimmy Callahan , pilot of the Pirates , did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant '' , but then goes on to comment : `` the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played '' . What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant - winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins . A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title : `` Buccaneers Take Last From Robins '' , but the subtitle of the article reads : `` Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4 , Making Series An Even Break '' . Another example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series , which identifies the matchup in the series as `` Dodgers vs. Indians '' despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years . The `` Robins '' nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager , Wilbert Robinson , who led the team from 1914 to 1931 . Uniforms ( edit ) The Dodgers ' home uniform has remained relatively unchanged for 70 years The Dodgers ' uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s . The home jersey is white with `` Dodgers '' written in script across the chest in Dodger Blue . The road jersey is gray with `` Los Angeles '' written in script across the chest in Dodger Blue . The word `` Dodgers '' was first used on the front of the team 's home jersey in 1933 ; the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and a stylized `` B '' on the left shoulder . The Dodgers also wore green outlined uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue the following year . The current design was created in 1939 , and has remained the same ever since with only cosmetic changes . In 1952 , the home uniform added a red uniform number under the `` Dodgers '' script . The road jersey also has a red uniform number under the script . When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles , the city name on the road jersey changed , and the stylized `` B '' was replaced with the interlocking `` LA '' on the caps in 1958 . In 1970 , the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had `` Dodgers '' on both the home and away uniforms . The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999 , and the tradition - rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 ( when all - blue satin uniforms were introduced ) . These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal blue top with the `` Dodgers '' script in white across the chest , and the red number on the front . These were worn with white pants and a new cap with silver brim , top button and Dodger logo . These alternates proved unpopular and the team abandoned them after only one season . In 2014 , the Dodgers introduced an alternate road jersey : a gray version with the `` Dodgers '' script instead of the city name . Current logo using `` Dodgers '' Script Los Angeles Dodgers Script on Dodger Blue Asian players ( edit ) Chan Ho Park The Dodgers have been groundbreaking in their signing of players from Asia ; mainly , Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan . Former owner Peter O'Malley began reaching out in 1980 by starting clinics in China and South Korea , building baseball fields in two Chinese cities , and in 1998 becoming the first major league team to open an office in Asia . The Dodgers were the second team to start a Japanese player in recent history , pitcher Hideo Nomo , the first team to start a South Korean player , pitcher Chan Ho Park , and the first Taiwanese player , Chin - Feng Chen . In addition , they were the first team to send out three Asian pitchers , from different Asian countries , in one game : Park , Hong - Chih Kuo of Taiwan , and Takashi Saito of Japan . In the 2008 season , the Dodgers had the most Asian players on its roster of any major league team with five . They included Japanese pitchers Takashi Saito and Hiroki Kuroda ; South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park ; and Taiwanese pitcher Hong - Chih Kuo and infielder Chin - Lung Hu . In 2005 , the Dodgers ' Hee Seop Choi became the first Asian player to compete in the Home Run Derby . For the 2013 season , the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Hyun - Jin Ryu with a six - year , $36 million contract , after posting a bid of nearly $27 million to acquire him from the KBO 's Hanhwa Eagles . For the 2016 season , the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Kenta Maeda with an eight - year , $25 million contract , after posting a bid of $20 million to acquire him from the NPB 's Hiroshima Toyo Carp . Rivalries ( edit ) The Dodgers ' rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dates back to the 19th century , when the two teams were based in New York ; the rivalry with the New York Yankees took place when the Dodgers were based in New York , but was revived with their East Coast / West Coast World Series battles in 1963 , 1977 , 1978 , and 1981 . The Dodgers rivalry with the Philadelphia Phillies also dates back to their days in New York , but was most fierce during the 1970s , 1980s , and 2000s . The Dodgers also had a heated rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s , 1980s and early 1990s . The rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the San Diego Padres dates back to the Angels ' and Padres ' respective inaugural seasons ( Angels in 1961 , Padres in 1969 ) . Regional proximity is behind the rivalries with both the Angels and the Padres . San Francisco Giants ( edit ) Main article : Dodgers -- Giants rivalry The Dodgers -- Giants rivalry is one of the longest - standing rivalries in American baseball . The feud between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City , with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan . After the 1957 season , Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley moved the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons . Along the way , he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham -- who was considering moving his team to Minnesota -- to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well . New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move . Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have been bitter rivals in economic , cultural , and political arenas for over a century and a half , the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation . Each team 's ability to endure for over a century while moving across an entire continent , as well as the rivalry 's leap from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement , have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in sports history . Unlike many other historic baseball match - ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history , the Dodgers -- Giants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams . While the Giants have more wins in franchise history , and lead all NL teams with 23 National League pennants , the Dodgers are second , having won 21 ; the Giants have won eight World Series titles , while the Dodgers have won six . The 2010 World Series was the Giants ' first championship since moving to California , while the Dodgers had won five World Series titles since their move , their last title coming in the 1988 World Series . Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim ( edit ) Main article : Freeway Series This rivalry refers to a series of games played with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim . The Freeway Series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area , the home of both teams ; one could travel from one team 's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5 . The term is akin to Subway Series which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams . The term `` Freeway Series '' also inspired the official name of the regions ' NHL rivalry : the Freeway Face - Off Historical rivalry ( edit ) New York Yankees ( edit ) Main articles : Dodgers -- Yankees rivalry and Subway Series The Dodgers -- Yankees rivalry is one of the most well - known rivalries in Major League Baseball . The two teams have met eleven times in the World Series , more times than any other pair from the American and National Leagues . The initial significance was embodied in the two teams ' proximity in New York City , when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn . After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958 , the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the dominant cities on each coast of the United States , and since the 1980s , the two largest cities in the United States . Although the rivalry 's significance arose from the two teams ' numerous World Series meetings , the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981 . They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004 , when they played a three - game interleague series . Their last meeting was in September 2016 , when the Dodgers won two out of three games in New York . Fan support ( edit ) A fan waves a rally towel during the 2008 NLCS The Dodgers have a loyal fanbase , evidenced by the fact that the Dodgers were the first MLB team to attract more than 3 million fans in a season ( in 1978 ) , and accomplished that feat six more times before any other franchise did it once . The Dodgers drew at least 3 million fans for 15 consecutive seasons from 1996 to 2010 , the longest such streak in all of MLB . On July 3 , 2007 , Dodgers management announced that total franchise attendance , dating back to 1901 , had reached 175 million , a record for all professional sports . In 2007 , the Dodgers set a franchise record for single - season attendance , attracting over 3.8 million fans . In 2009 , the Dodgers led MLB in total attendance . The Dodger baseball cap is consistently in the top three in sales . During the 2011 - 2012 season , Frank McCourt , the owner of the Dodgers at that time , was going through a rough divorce with his wife over who should be the owner of the Dodger team . Instead , Frank McCourt paid $131 million to his wife as part of the divorce settlement . As a result , the team payroll was financially low for a big - budget team crippling the Dodgers in the free - agent market . Collectively , the team performance waned due to the distracting drama in the front office resulting in low attendance numbers . Given the team 's proximity to Hollywood , numerous celebrities can often be seen attending home games at Dodger Stadium . Celebrities such as co-owner Magic Johnson , Mary Hart , Larry King , Tiger Woods , Alyssa Milano and Shia LaBeouf are known to sit at field box seats behind home plate where they sign autographs for fellow Dodger fans . Actor Bryan Cranston is a lifelong Dodger fan . The Dodgers set the world record for the largest attendance for a single baseball game during an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox on March 28 , 2008 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in honor of the Dodgers 50th anniversary , with 115,300 fans in attendance . All proceeds from the game benefited the official charity of the Dodgers , ThinkCure ! which supports cancer research at Children 's Hospital Los Angeles and City of Hope . Primarily Dodgers fans are from their own location in southern California and also parts of southern Nevada ; however there are also strong pockets of Dodger support in Mexico and throughout Asia , and their away games throughout the US will usually attract substantial numbers of expat and traveling fans . Radio and television ( edit ) Main article : List of Los Angeles Dodgers broadcasters Hall of Fame Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully Vin Scully had called Dodgers games from 1950 to 2016 . His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett ( 1956 -- 1987 ) and Ross Porter ( 1977 -- 2004 ) . In 1976 , he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality ( on the field or off ) in the team 's history . He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame 's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters ( inducted in 1982 ) . Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on - air conversation ( usually with one functioning as play - by - play announcer and the other ( s ) as color commentator ) , Scully , Doggett and Porter generally called games solo , trading with each other inning - by - inning . In the 1980s and 1990s , Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the third and seventh inning , allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning . When Doggett retired after the 1987 season , he was replaced by Hall - of - Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale , who previously broadcast games for the California Angels and Chicago White Sox . Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in Montreal in 1993 . This was a difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter who could not mention it on - air until Drysdale 's family had been notified and the official announcement made . He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday . Porter 's tenure ended after the 2004 season , after which the format of play - by - play announcers and color commentators was installed , led by Monday and newcomer Charley Steiner . Scully , however , continued to announce solo . Scully called roughly 100 games per season ( all home games and road games in California and Arizona ) for both flagship radio station KLAC and on television for SportsNet LA . Scully was simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances , then announced only for the TV audience . If Scully was calling the game , Steiner took over play - by - play on radio beginning with the fourth inning , with Monday as color commentator . If Scully was not calling the game , Steiner and Orel Hershiser called the entire game on television while Monday and Kevin Kennedy did the same on radio . In the event the Dodgers were in post-season play , Scully called the first three and last three innings of the radio broadcast alone and Steiner and Monday handled the middle innings . Vin Scully retired from calling games in 2016 . His tenure with the Dodgers was the longest with any single sports team at 67 years . The Dodgers also broadcast on radio in Spanish , and the play - by - play is voiced by another Frick Award winner , Jaime Jarrín , who has been with the Dodgers since 1959 . The color analyst for some games is former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela , for whom Jarrin once translated post-game interviews . The Spanish - language radio flagship station is KTNQ .

This was the year in which Koufax was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame ; Robinson and Campanella were already Hall - of - Famers . Alston 's number was retired in the year following his retirement as the Dodgers manager , six years before he was inducted into the Hall of Fame . Gilliam died suddenly in 1978 after a 28 - year career with the Dodgers organization . The Dodgers retired his number two days after his death , prior to Game 1 of the 1978 World Series . He is the only non-Hall - of - Famer to have his number retired by the Dodgers . Beginning in 1980 , the Dodgers have retired the numbers of longtime Dodgers ( Snider , Reese , Drysdale , Lasorda , and Sutton ) during the seasons in which each was inducted into the Hall of Fame . In 1997 , 50 years after he broke the color barrier and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number , Robinson 's No. 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball . Robinson is the only major league baseball player to have this honor bestowed upon him . Starting in the 2007 season , Jackie Robinson Day ( April 15 , commemorating Opening Day of Robinson 's rookie season of 1947 ) has featured many or all players and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson . The Dodgers have not issued the number 34 since the departure of Fernando Valenzuela in 1991 , although it has not been officially retired .

Over the nearly 43 years from 1954 to mid-1996 , the Dodgers employed only two managers , Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda , both of whom are in the Hall of Fame . During this entire time period of extraordinary stability , the Dodgers were family owned by Walter O'Malley and then his son Peter O'Malley . It was during this era that the Dodgers won 11 of their 21 pennants , and all six of their World Series championships . The managers of the Los Angeles Dodgers ( 1958 -- present ) are as follows : Walter Alston ( 1958 -- 1976 ) ( in Brooklyn since 1954 ) Tommy Lasorda ( 1976 -- 1996 ) Bill Russell ( 1996 -- 1998 ) Glenn Hoffman ( 1998 ) Davey Johnson ( 1999 -- 2000 ) Jim Tracy ( 2001 -- 2005 ) Grady Little ( 2006 -- 2007 ) Joe Torre ( 2008 -- 2010 ) Don Mattingly ( 2011 -- 2015 ) Dave Roberts ( 2016 -- present ) General Managers ( edit ) Larry MacPhail ( 1938 -- 1942 ) Branch Rickey ( 1943 -- 1950 ) Buzzie Bavasi ( 1950 -- 1968 ) Fresco Thompson ( 1968 ) Al Campanis ( 1968 -- 1987 ) Fred Claire ( 1987 -- 1998 ) Tommy Lasorda ( 1998 ) Kevin Malone ( 1999 -- 2001 ) Dave Wallace ( 2001 ) Dan Evans ( 2001 -- 2004 ) Paul DePodesta ( 2004 -- 2005 ) Ned Colletti ( 2005 -- 2014 ) Farhan Zaidi ( 2014 -- present ) Public address announcers / organists ( edit ) From the Dodgers ' move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958 , the Dodgers employed a handful of well - known public address announcers ; the most famous of which was John Ramsey , who served as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982 ; as well as announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues , including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena , and the Forum . Ramsey died in 1990 . From 1958 to 1982 , Doug Moore , a local businessman ; Philip Petty , an Orange County Superior Court Judge ; and Dennis Packer ; served as back - up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers , California Angels , Los Angeles Chargers , USC football and Los Angeles Rams . Packer was Ramsey 's primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey 's retirement from the Forum in 1978 . Thereafter , Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers , Kings , indoor soccer and indoor tennis events at the Forum . Nick Nickson , a radio broadcaster for the Los Angeles Kings , replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full - time . Dennis Packer and Pete Arbogast were emulators of John Ramsey , using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for . Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the 1994 FIFA World Cup matches at the Rose Bowl . Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25 , 1990 , by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey 's opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game . His replacement , in 1993 was Mike Carlucci , who remained as the Dodgers ' PA voice until 2003 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties . Through 2014 , the Dodgers public address announcer was Eric Smith , who also announces for the Los Angeles Clippers and USC Trojans . On April 3 , 2015 the Dodgers announced that former radio broadcaster Todd Leitz would become their new public address announcer . Leitz was an anchor and news reporter in Los Angeles at KNX 1070 AM for 10 years , and a news reporter at KABC 790 for two years . During their time in Brooklyn , stadium organist Gladys Gooding became so well - known that fans would joke that she was `` the only Dodger who played every game without an error '' . Until 2015 , Nancy Bea enjoyed a similar level of popularity behind the Dodger Stadium keyboard . Her replacement and current organist is Dieter Ruehle , who also plays at Staples Center for Los Angeles Kings and Los Angeles Lakers games . Other ( edit ) Vin Scully is permanently honored in the Hall 's `` Scribes & Mikemen '' exhibit as a result of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1982 . As with all Frick Award recipients , he is not officially considered an inducted member of the Hall of Fame . Sue Falsone , served as the first female physical therapist in Major League baseball , and from 2012 to 2013 , was the first female head athletic trainer .

For other uses , see Probability ( disambiguation ) . Probability Outline Catalog of articles Probabilists Glossary Notation Journals Category Part of a series on Certainty Approximation Belief Certainty Doubt Determinism Fallibilism Fatalism Hypothesis Justification Nihilism Proof Scientific theory Skepticism Solipsism Theory Truth Uncertainty Related concepts and fundamentals : Agnosticism Epistemology Presupposition Probability Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur . See glossary of probability and statistics . Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 , where , loosely speaking , 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty . The higher the probability of an event , the more likely it is that the event will occur . A simple example is the tossing of a fair ( unbiased ) coin . Since the coin is fair , the two outcomes ( `` heads '' and `` tails '' ) are both equally probable ; the probability of `` heads '' equals the probability of `` tails '' ; and since no other outcomes are possible , the probability of either `` heads '' or `` tails '' is 1 / 2 ( which could also be written as 0.5 or 50 % ) . These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory , which is used widely in such areas of study as mathematics , statistics , finance , gambling , science ( in particular physics ) , artificial intelligence / machine learning , computer science , game theory , and philosophy to , for example , draw inferences about the expected frequency of events . Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems . When dealing with experiments that are random and well - defined in a purely theoretical setting ( like tossing a fair coin ) , probabilities can be numerically described by the number of desired outcomes divided by the total number of all outcomes . For example , tossing a fair coin twice will yield `` head - head '' , `` head - tail '' , `` tail - head '' , and `` tail - tail '' outcomes . The probability of getting an outcome of `` head - head '' is 1 out of 4 outcomes or 1 / 4 or 0.25 ( or 25 % ) . When it comes to practical application however , there are two major competing categories of probability interpretations , whose adherents possess different views about the fundamental nature of probability : Objectivists assign numbers to describe some objective or physical state of affairs . The most popular version of objective probability is frequentist probability , which claims that the probability of a random event denotes the relative frequency of occurrence of an experiment 's outcome , when repeating the experiment . This interpretation considers probability to be the relative frequency `` in the long run '' of outcomes . A modification of this is propensity probability , which interprets probability as the tendency of some experiment to yield a certain outcome , even if it is performed only once . Subjectivists assign numbers per subjective probability , i.e. , as a degree of belief . The degree of belief has been interpreted as , `` the price at which you would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E , 0 if not E . '' The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability , which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities . The expert knowledge is represented by some ( subjective ) prior probability distribution . These data are incorporated in a likelihood function . The product of the prior and the likelihood , normalized , results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date . By Aumann 's agreement theorem , Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar will end up with similar posterior beliefs . However , sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions regardless of how much information the agents share . Etymology ( edit ) See also : History of probability § Etymology Further information : Likelihood The word probability derives from the Latin probabilitas , which can also mean `` probity '' , a measure of the authority of a witness in a legal case in Europe , and often correlated with the witness 's nobility . In a sense , this differs much from the modern meaning of probability , which , in contrast , is a measure of the weight of empirical evidence , and is arrived at from inductive reasoning and statistical inference . History ( edit ) Main article : History of probability The scientific study of probability is a modern development of mathematics . Gambling shows that there has been an interest in quantifying the ideas of probability for millennia , but exact mathematical descriptions arose much later . There are reasons for the slow development of the mathematics of probability . Whereas games of chance provided the impetus for the mathematical study of probability , fundamental issues are still obscured by the superstitions of gamblers . Christiaan Huygens likely published the first book on probability According to Richard Jeffrey , `` Before the middle of the seventeenth century , the term ' probable ' ( Latin probabilis ) meant approvable , and was applied in that sense , unequivocally , to opinion and to action . A probable action or opinion was one such as sensible people would undertake or hold , in the circumstances . '' However , in legal contexts especially , ' probable ' could also apply to propositions for which there was good evidence . Gerolamo Cardano The sixteenth century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes ( which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes ) . Aside from the elementary work by Cardano , the doctrine of probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal ( 1654 ) . Christiaan Huygens ( 1657 ) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject . Jakob Bernoulli 's Ars Conjectandi ( posthumous , 1713 ) and Abraham de Moivre 's Doctrine of Chances ( 1718 ) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics . See Ian Hacking 's The Emergence of Probability and James Franklin 's The Science of Conjecture for histories of the early development of the very concept of mathematical probability . The theory of errors may be traced back to Roger Cotes 's Opera Miscellanea ( posthumous , 1722 ) , but a memoir prepared by Thomas Simpson in 1755 ( printed 1756 ) first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation . The reprint ( 1757 ) of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable , and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors . Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve . The first two laws of error that were proposed both originated with Pierre - Simon Laplace . The first law was published in 1774 and stated that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude of the error , disregarding sign . The second law of error was proposed in 1778 by Laplace and stated that the frequency of the error is an exponential function of the square of the error . The second law of error is called the normal distribution or the Gauss law . `` It is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss , who in spite of his well - known precocity had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old . '' Daniel Bernoulli ( 1778 ) introduced the principle of the maximum product of the probabilities of a system of concurrent errors . Carl Friedrich Gauss Adrien - Marie Legendre ( 1805 ) developed the method of least squares , and introduced it in his Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des orbites des comètes ( New Methods for Determining the Orbits of Comets ) . In ignorance of Legendre 's contribution , an Irish - American writer , Robert Adrain , editor of `` The Analyst '' ( 1808 ) , first deduced the law of facility of error , φ ( x ) = c e − h 2 x 2 , ( \\ displaystyle \\ phi ( x ) = ce ^ ( - h ^ ( 2 ) x ^ ( 2 ) ) , ) where h ( \\ displaystyle h ) is a constant depending on precision of observation , and c ( \\ displaystyle c ) is a scale factor ensuring that the area under the curve equals 1 . He gave two proofs , the second being essentially the same as John Herschel 's ( 1850 ) . Gauss gave the first proof that seems to have been known in Europe ( the third after Adrain 's ) in 1809 . Further proofs were given by Laplace ( 1810 , 1812 ) , Gauss ( 1823 ) , James Ivory ( 1825 , 1826 ) , Hagen ( 1837 ) , Friedrich Bessel ( 1838 ) , W.F. Donkin ( 1844 , 1856 ) , and Morgan Crofton ( 1870 ) . Other contributors were Ellis ( 1844 ) , De Morgan ( 1864 ) , Glaisher ( 1872 ) , and Giovanni Schiaparelli ( 1875 ) . Peters 's ( 1856 ) formula for r , the probable error of a single observation , is well known . In the nineteenth century authors on the general theory included Laplace , Sylvestre Lacroix ( 1816 ) , Littrow ( 1833 ) , Adolphe Quetelet ( 1853 ) , Richard Dedekind ( 1860 ) , Helmert ( 1872 ) , Hermann Laurent ( 1873 ) , Liagre , Didion , and Karl Pearson . Augustus De Morgan and George Boole improved the exposition of the theory . Andrey Markov introduced the notion of Markov chains ( 1906 ) , which played an important role in stochastic processes theory and its applications . The modern theory of probability based on the measure theory was developed by Andrey Kolmogorov ( 1931 ) . On the geometric side ( see integral geometry ) contributors to The Educational Times were influential ( Miller , Crofton , McColl , Wolstenholme , Watson , and Artemas Martin ) . Further information : History of statistics Theory ( edit ) Main article : Probability theory Like other theories , the theory of probability is a representation of its concepts in formal terms -- that is , in terms that can be considered separately from their meaning . These formal terms are manipulated by the rules of mathematics and logic , and any results are interpreted or translated back into the problem domain . There have been at least two successful attempts to formalize probability , namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation . In Kolmogorov 's formulation ( see probability space ) , sets are interpreted as events and probability itself as a measure on a class of sets . In Cox 's theorem , probability is taken as a primitive ( that is , not further analyzed ) and the emphasis is on constructing a consistent assignment of probability values to propositions . In both cases , the laws of probability are the same , except for technical details . There are other methods for quantifying uncertainty , such as the Dempster -- Shafer theory or possibility theory , but those are essentially different and not compatible with the laws of probability as usually understood . Applications ( edit ) Probability theory is applied in everyday life in risk assessment and modeling . The insurance industry and markets use actuarial science to determine pricing and make trading decisions . Governments apply probabilistic methods in environmental regulation , entitlement analysis ( Reliability theory of aging and longevity ) , and financial regulation . A good example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices , which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole . An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity 's prices up or down , and signals other traders of that opinion . Accordingly , the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally . The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing , on policy , and on peace and conflict . In addition to financial assessment , probability can be used to analyze trends in biology ( e.g. disease spread ) as well as ecology ( e.g. biological Punnett squares ) . As with finance , risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances . Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit , yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play . The discovery of rigorous methods to assess and combine probability assessments has changed society . It is important for most citizens to understand how probability assessments are made , and how they contribute to decisions . Another significant application of probability theory in everyday life is reliability . Many consumer products , such as automobiles and consumer electronics , use reliability theory in product design to reduce the probability of failure . Failure probability may influence a manufacturer 's decisions on a product 's warranty . The cache language model and other statistical language models that are used in natural language processing are also examples of applications of probability theory . Mathematical treatment ( edit ) See also : Probability axioms Consider an experiment that can produce a number of results . The collection of all possible results is called the sample space of the experiment . The power set of the sample space is formed by considering all different collections of possible results . For example , rolling a dice can produce six possible results . One collection of possible results gives an odd number on the dice . Thus , the subset ( 1 , 3 , 5 ) is an element of the power set of the sample space of dice rolls . These collections are called `` events '' . In this case , ( 1 , 3 , 5 ) is the event that the dice falls on some odd number . If the results that actually occur fall in a given event , the event is said to have occurred . A probability is a way of assigning every event a value between zero and one , with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results ( in our example , the event ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) ) is assigned a value of one . To qualify as a probability , the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that if you look at a collection of mutually exclusive events ( events with no common results , e.g. , the events ( 1 , 6 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 2 , 4 ) are all mutually exclusive ) , the probability that at least one of the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events . The probability of an event A is written as P ( A ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A ) ) , p ( A ) ( \\ displaystyle p ( A ) ) , or Pr ( A ) ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ text ( Pr ) ) ( A ) ) . This mathematical definition of probability can extend to infinite sample spaces , and even uncountable sample spaces , using the concept of a measure . The opposite or complement of an event A is the event ( not A ) ( that is , the event of A not occurring ) , often denoted as A _̄ , A ∁ , ¬ A ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ overline ( A ) ) , A ^ ( \\ complement ) , \\ neg A ) , or ∼ A ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ sim ) A ) ; its probability is given by P ( not A ) = 1 − P ( A ) . As an example , the chance of not rolling a six on a six - sided die is 1 -- ( chance of rolling a six ) = 1 − 1 6 = 5 6 ( \\ displaystyle = 1 - ( \\ tfrac ( 1 ) ( 6 ) ) = ( \\ tfrac ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ) ) . See Complementary event for a more complete treatment . If two events A and B occur on a single performance of an experiment , this is called the intersection or joint probability of A and B , denoted as P ( A ∩ B ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A \\ cap B ) ) . Independent events ( edit ) If two events , A and B are independent then the joint probability is P ( A and B ) = P ( A ∩ B ) = P ( A ) P ( B ) , ( \\ displaystyle P ( A ( \\ mbox ( and ) ) B ) = P ( A \\ cap B ) = P ( A ) P ( B ) , \\ , ) for example , if two coins are flipped the chance of both being heads is 1 2 × 1 2 = 1 4 ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ tfrac ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) \\ times ( \\ tfrac ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) = ( \\ tfrac ( 1 ) ( 4 ) ) ) . Mutually exclusive events ( edit ) If either event A or event B but never both occurs on a single performance of an experiment , then they are called mutually exclusive events . If two events are mutually exclusive then the probability of both occurring is denoted as P ( A ∩ B ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A \\ cap B ) ) . P ( A and B ) = P ( A ∩ B ) = 0 ( \\ displaystyle P ( A ( \\ mbox ( and ) ) B ) = P ( A \\ cap B ) = 0 ) If two events are mutually exclusive then the probability of either occurring is denoted as P ( A ∪ B ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A \\ cup B ) ) . P ( A or B ) = P ( A ∪ B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) − P ( A ∩ B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) − 0 = P ( A ) + P ( B ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A ( \\ mbox ( or ) ) B ) = P ( A \\ cup B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) - P ( A \\ cap B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) - 0 = P ( A ) + P ( B ) ) For example , the chance of rolling a 1 or 2 on a six - sided die is P ( 1 or 2 ) = P ( 1 ) + P ( 2 ) = 1 6 + 1 6 = 1 3 . ( \\ displaystyle P ( 1 ( \\ mbox ( or ) ) 2 ) = P ( 1 ) + P ( 2 ) = ( \\ tfrac ( 1 ) ( 6 ) ) + ( \\ tfrac ( 1 ) ( 6 ) ) = ( \\ tfrac ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ) . ) Not mutually exclusive events ( edit ) If the events are not mutually exclusive then P ( A or B ) = P ( A ∪ B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) − P ( A and B ) . ( \\ displaystyle P \\ left ( A ( \\ hbox ( or ) ) B \\ right ) = P ( A \\ cup B ) = P \\ left ( A \\ right ) + P \\ left ( B \\ right ) - P \\ left ( A ( \\ mbox ( and ) ) B \\ right ) . ) For example , when drawing a single card at random from a regular deck of cards , the chance of getting a heart or a face card ( J , Q , K ) ( or one that is both ) is 13 52 + 12 52 − 3 52 = 11 26 ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ tfrac ( 13 ) ( 52 ) ) + ( \\ tfrac ( 12 ) ( 52 ) ) - ( \\ tfrac ( 3 ) ( 52 ) ) = ( \\ tfrac ( 11 ) ( 26 ) ) ) , because of the 52 cards of a deck 13 are hearts , 12 are face cards , and 3 are both : here the possibilities included in the `` 3 that are both '' are included in each of the `` 13 hearts '' and the `` 12 face cards '' but should only be counted once . Conditional probability ( edit ) Conditional probability is the probability of some event A , given the occurrence of some other event B. Conditional probability is written P ( A ∣ B ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A \\ mid B ) ) , and is read `` the probability of A , given B '' . It is defined by P ( A ∣ B ) = P ( A ∩ B ) P ( B ) . ( \\ displaystyle P ( A \\ mid B ) = ( \\ frac ( P ( A \\ cap B ) ) ( P ( B ) ) ). \\ , ) If P ( B ) = 0 ( \\ displaystyle P ( B ) = 0 ) then P ( A ∣ B ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A \\ mid B ) ) is formally undefined by this expression . However , it is possible to define a conditional probability for some zero - probability events using a σ - algebra of such events ( such as those arising from a continuous random variable ) . For example , in a bag of 2 red balls and 2 blue balls ( 4 balls in total ) , the probability of taking a red ball is 1 / 2 ( \\ displaystyle 1 / 2 ) ; however , when taking a second ball , the probability of it being either a red ball or a blue ball depends on the ball previously taken , such as , if a red ball was taken , the probability of picking a red ball again would be 1 / 3 ( \\ displaystyle 1 / 3 ) since only 1 red and 2 blue balls would have been remaining . Inverse probability ( edit ) In probability theory and applications , Bayes ' rule relates the odds of event A 1 ( \\ displaystyle A_ ( 1 ) ) to event A 2 ( \\ displaystyle A_ ( 2 ) ) , before ( prior to ) and after ( posterior to ) conditioning on another event B ( \\ displaystyle B ) . The odds on A 1 ( \\ displaystyle A_ ( 1 ) ) to event A 2 ( \\ displaystyle A_ ( 2 ) ) is simply the ratio of the probabilities of the two events . When arbitrarily many events A ( \\ displaystyle A ) are of interest , not just two , the rule can be rephrased as posterior is proportional to prior times likelihood , P ( A B ) ∝ P ( A ) P ( B A ) ( \\ displaystyle P ( A B ) \\ propto P ( A ) P ( B A ) ) where the proportionality symbol means that the left hand side is proportional to ( i.e. , equals a constant times ) the right hand side as A ( \\ displaystyle A ) varies , for fixed or given B ( \\ displaystyle B ) ( Lee , 2012 ; Bertsch McGrayne , 2012 ) . In this form it goes back to Laplace ( 1774 ) and to Cournot ( 1843 ) ; see Fienberg ( 2005 ) . See Inverse probability and Bayes ' rule .

You can help by adding to it . ( April 2017 ) In a deterministic universe , based on Newtonian concepts , there would be no probability if all conditions were known ( Laplace 's demon ) , ( but there are situations in which sensitivity to initial conditions exceeds our ability to measure them , i.e. know them ) . In the case of a roulette wheel , if the force of the hand and the period of that force are known , the number on which the ball will stop would be a certainty ( though as a practical matter , this would likely be true only of a roulette wheel that had not been exactly levelled -- as Thomas A. Bass ' Newtonian Casino revealed ) . This also assumes knowledge of inertia and friction of the wheel , weight , smoothness and roundness of the ball , variations in hand speed during the turning and so forth . A probabilistic description can thus be more useful than Newtonian mechanics for analyzing the pattern of outcomes of repeated rolls of a roulette wheel . Physicists face the same situation in kinetic theory of gases , where the system , while deterministic in principle , is so complex ( with the number of molecules typically the order of magnitude of the Avogadro constant 7023602000000000000 ♠ 6.02 × 10 ) that only a statistical description of its properties is feasible . Probability theory is required to describe quantum phenomena . A revolutionary discovery of early 20th century physics was the random character of all physical processes that occur at sub-atomic scales and are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics . The objective wave function evolves deterministically but , according to the Copenhagen interpretation , it deals with probabilities of observing , the outcome being explained by a wave function collapse when an observation is made . However , the loss of determinism for the sake of instrumentalism did not meet with universal approval . Albert Einstein famously remarked in a letter to Max Born : `` I am convinced that God does not play dice '' . Like Einstein , Erwin Schrödinger , who discovered the wave function , believed quantum mechanics is a statistical approximation of an underlying deterministic reality . In some modern interpretations of the statistical mechanics of measurement , quantum decoherence is invoked to account for the appearance of subjectively probabilistic experimental outcomes .

Webster 's Revised Unabridged Dictionary . G & C Merriam , 1913 Jump up ^ Strictly speaking , a probability of 0 indicates that an event almost never takes place , whereas a probability of 1 indicates than an event almost certainly takes place . This is an important distinction when the sample space is infinite . For example , for the continuous uniform distribution on the real interval ( 5 , 10 ) , there are an infinite number of possible outcomes , and the probability of any given outcome being observed -- for instance , exactly 7 -- is 0 . This means that when we make an observation , it will almost surely not be exactly 7 . However , it does not mean that exactly 7 is impossible . Ultimately some specific outcome ( with probability 0 ) will be observed , and one possibility for that specific outcome is exactly 7 .

Alfred Prufrock Jump to : navigation , search The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T.S. Eliot First published in June 1915 issue of Poetry Country United States Language English Publisher magazine ( 1915 ) : Harriet Monroe chapbook ( 1917 ) : The Egoist , Ltd . ( London ) Lines 140 Pages 6 ( 1915 printing ) 8 ( 1917 printing ) Read online The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock at Wikisource `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' , commonly known as `` Prufrock '' , is the first professionally published poem by American - born , British poet T.S. Eliot ( 1888 -- 1965 ) . Eliot began writing `` Prufrock '' in February 1910 , and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of Poetry : A Magazine of Verse at the instigation of Ezra Pound ( 1885 -- 1972 ) . It was later printed as part of a twelve - poem pamphlet ( or chapbook ) titled Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917 . At the time of its publication , Prufrock was considered outlandish , but is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic cultural shift from late 19th - century Romantic verse and Georgian lyrics to Modernism . The poem 's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot 's extensive reading of Dante Alighieri and makes several references to the Bible and other literary works -- including William Shakespeare 's plays Henry IV Part II , Twelfth Night , and Hamlet , the poetry of seventeenth - century metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell , and the nineteenth - century French Symbolists . Eliot narrates the experience of Prufrock using the stream of consciousness technique developed by his fellow Modernist writers . The poem , described as a `` drama of literary anguish '' , is a dramatic interior monologue of an urban man , stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action that is said `` to epitomize frustration and impotence of the modern individual '' and `` represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment '' . Prufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia , the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress , and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love . With visceral feelings of weariness , regret , embarrassment , longing , emasculation , sexual frustration , a sense of decay , and an awareness of mortality , `` Prufrock '' has become one of the most recognised voices in modern literature . Eliot wrote `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' between February 1910 and July or August 1911 . Shortly after arriving in England to attend Merton College , Oxford , Eliot was introduced to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound , who instantly deemed Eliot `` worth watching '' and aided the start of Eliot 's career . Pound served as the overseas editor of Poetry : A Magazine of Verse and recommended to the magazine 's founder , Harriet Monroe , that Poetry publish `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' , extolling that Eliot and his work embodied a new and unique phenomenon among contemporary writers . Pound claimed that Eliot `` has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN . The rest of the promising young have done one or the other , but never both . '' The poem was first published by the magazine in its June 1915 issue . In November 1915 `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' -- along with Eliot 's poems `` Portrait of a Lady , '' `` The Boston Evening Transcript , '' `` Hysteria , '' and `` Miss Helen Slingsby '' -- was included in Catholic Anthology 1914 -- 1915 edited by Ezra Pound and printed by Elkin Mathews in London . In June 1917 The Egoist , a small publishing firm run by Dora Marsden , published a pamphlet entitled Prufrock and Other Observations ( London ) , containing twelve poems by Eliot . `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' was the first in the volume . Also Eliot was appointed assistant editor of the Egoist in June 1917 . Prufrock 's Pervigilium ( edit ) According to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon , when Eliot was writing the first drafts of Prufrock in his notebook in 1910 -- 1911 , he intentionally kept four pages blank in the middle section of the poem . According to the notebooks , now in the collection of the New York Public Library , Eliot finished the poem that was originally published sometime in July and August 1911 -- when he was 22 years old . In 1912 , Eliot revised the poem and included a 38 - line section now called `` Prufrock 's Pervigilium '' which was inserted on those blank pages , and intended as a middle section for the poem . However , Eliot removed this section soon after seeking the advice of his fellow Harvard acquaintance and poet Conrad Aiken . This section would not be included in the original publication of Eliot 's poem but was included when published posthumously in the 1996 collection of Eliot 's early , unpublished drafts in Inventions of the March Hare : Poems 1909 -- 1917 . This Pervigilium section describes the `` vigil '' of Prufrock through an evening and night described by one reviewer as an `` erotic foray into the narrow streets of a social and emotional underworld '' that portray `` in clammy detail Prufrock 's tramping ' through certain half - deserted streets ' and the context of his ' muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one - night cheap hotels . ' '' Critical reception ( edit ) Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917 . `` The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone , even to himself . They certainly have no relation to poetry . '' The Harvard Vocarium at Harvard College recorded Eliot 's reading of Prufrock and other poems in 1947 , as part of their ongoing series of poetry readings by their authors . Description ( edit ) Title ( edit ) In his early drafts , Eliot gave the poem the subtitle `` Prufrock among the Women . '' This subtitle was apparently discarded before publication . Eliot called the poem a `` love song '' in reference to Rudyard Kipling 's poem `` The Love Song of Har Dyal , '' first published in Kipling 's collection Plain Tales from the Hills ( 1888 ) . In 1959 , Eliot addressed a meeting of the Kipling Society and discussed the influence of Kipling upon his own poetry : Traces of Kipling appear in my own mature verse where no diligent scholarly sleuth has yet observed them , but which I am myself prepared to disclose . I once wrote a poem called `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' : I am convinced that it would never have been called `` Love Song '' but for a title of Kipling 's that stuck obstinately in my head : `` The Love Song of Har Dyal '' . However , the origin of the name Prufrock is not certain , and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name . Many scholars and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock , and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as `` T. Stearns Eliot , '' very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock . It is suggested that the name `` Prufrock '' came from Eliot 's youth in St. Louis , Missouri , where the Prufrock - Litton Company , a large furniture store , occupied one city block downtown at 420 -- 422 North Fourth Street . In a 1950 letter , Eliot said , `` I did not have , at the time of writing the poem , and have not yet recovered , any recollection of having acquired this name in any way , but I think that it must be assumed that I did , and that the memory has been obliterated . '' Epigraph ( edit ) The draft version of the poem 's epigraph comes from Dante 's Purgatorio ( XXVI , 147 -- 148 ) : ' sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor ' . Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina . ' be mindful in due time of my pain ' . Then dived he back into that fire which refines them . He finally decided not to use this , but eventually used the quotation in the closing lines of his 1922 poem The Waste Land . The quotation that Eliot did choose comes from Dante also . Inferno ( XXVII , 61 -- 66 ) reads : S ` io credesse che mia risposta fosse A persona che mai tornasse al mondo , Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse . Ma perciocchè giammai di questo fondo Non tornò vivo alcun , s'i'odo il vero , Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo . If I but thought that my response were made to one perhaps returning to the world , this tongue of flame would cease to flicker . But since , up from these depths , no one has yet returned alive , if what I hear is true , I answer without fear of being shamed . In context , the epigraph refers to a meeting between Dante and Guido da Montefeltro , who was condemned to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII , who wished to use Guido 's advice for a nefarious undertaking . This encounter follows Dante 's meeting with Ulysses , who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent . According to Ron Banerjee , the epigraph serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock 's intent . Like Guido , Prufrock had never intended his story to be told , and so by quoting Guido , Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock 's love song . Frederick Locke contends that Prufrock himself is suffering from multiple personalities of sorts , and that he embodies both Guido and Dante in the Inferno analogy . One is the storyteller ; the other the listener who later reveals the story to the world . He posits , alternatively , that the role of Guido in the analogy is indeed filled by Prufrock , but that the role of Dante is filled by you , the reader , as in `` Let us go then , you and I , '' ( 1 ) . In that , the reader is granted the power to do as he pleases with Prufrock 's love song . Themes and interpretation ( edit ) Because the poem is concerned primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator , it can be difficult to interpret . Laurence Perrine wrote , `` ( the poem ) presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person 's head within a certain time interval , in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical '' . This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic . On the surface , `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle - aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so , and ultimately does not . The dispute , however , lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking , whether he is actually going anywhere , what he wants to say , and to what the various images refer . The intended audience is not evident . Some believe that Prufrock is talking to another person or directly to the reader , while others believe Prufrock 's monologue is internal . Perrine writes `` The ' you and I ' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock 's own nature '' , while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the `` you and I '' refers to the relationship between the dilemmas of the character and the author . Similarly , critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere during the course of the poem . In the first half of the poem , Prufrock uses various outdoor images ( the sky , streets , cheap restaurants and hotels , fog ) , and talks about how there will be time for various things before `` the taking of a toast and tea '' , and `` time to turn back and descend the stair . '' This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea , where he is preparing to ask this `` overwhelming question '' . Others , however , believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere , but rather , is playing through it in his mind . Perhaps the most significant dispute lies over the `` overwhelming question '' that Prufrock is trying to ask . Many believe that Prufrock is trying to tell a woman of his romantic interest in her , pointing to the various images of women 's arms and clothing and the final few lines in which Prufrock laments that the mermaids will not sing to him . Others , however , believe that Prufrock is trying to express some deeper philosophical insight or disillusionment with society , but fears rejection , pointing to statements that express a disillusionment with society , such as `` I have measured out my life with coffee spoons '' ( line 51 ) . Many believe that the poem is a criticism of Edwardian society and Prufrock 's dilemma represents the inability to live a meaningful existence in the modern world . McCoy and Harlan wrote `` For many readers in the 1920s , Prufrock seemed to epitomize the frustration and impotence of the modern individual . He seemed to represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment . '' In general , Eliot uses imagery which is indicative of Prufrock 's character , representing ageing and decay . For example , `` When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table '' ( lines 2 -- 3 ) , the `` sawdust restaurants '' and `` cheap hotels , '' the yellow fog , and the afternoon `` Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers '' ( line 77 ) , are reminiscent of languor and decay , while Prufrock 's various concerns about his hair and teeth , as well as the mermaids `` Combing the white hair of the waves blown back / When the wind blows the water white and black , '' show his concern over aging . Use of allusion ( edit ) Like many of Eliot 's poems , `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' makes numerous allusions to other works , which are often symbolic themselves . In `` Time for all the works and days of hands '' ( 29 ) the phrase ' works and days ' is the title of a long poem -- a description of agricultural life and a call to toil -- by the early Greek poet Hesiod . `` I know the voices dying with a dying fall '' ( 52 ) echoes Orsino 's first lines in Shakespeare 's Twelfth Night . The prophet of `` Though I have seen my head ( grown slightly bald ) brought in upon a platter / I am no prophet -- and here 's no great matter '' ( 81 -- 2 ) is John the Baptist , whose head was delivered to Salome by Herod as a reward for her dancing ( Matthew 14 : 1 -- 11 , and Oscar Wilde 's play Salome ) . `` To have squeezed the universe into a ball '' ( 92 ) and `` indeed there will be time '' ( 23 ) echo the closing lines of Marvell 's ' To His Coy Mistress ' . Other phrases such as , `` there will be time '' and `` there is time '' are reminiscent of the opening line of that poem : `` Had we but world enough and time '' . Marvell 's words in turn echo the General Prologue of Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , `` whil I have tyme and space '' . `` ' I am Lazarus , come from the dead ' '' ( 94 ) may be either the beggar Lazarus ( of Luke 16 ) returning for the rich man who was not permitted to return from the dead to warn the brothers of a rich man about Hell , or the Lazarus ( of John 11 ) whom Christ raised from the dead , or both . `` Full of high sentence '' ( 117 ) echoes Chaucer 's description of the Clerk of Oxford in the General Prologue to The Canterbury Tales . `` There will be time to murder and create '' is a biblical allusion to Ecclesiastes 3 . In the final section of the poem , Prufrock rejects the idea that he is Prince Hamlet , suggesting that he is merely `` an attendant lord '' ( 112 ) whose purpose is to `` advise the prince '' ( 114 ) , a likely allusion to Polonius -- Polonius being also `` almost , at times , the Fool . '' `` Among some talk of you and me '' may be a reference to Quatrain 32 of Edward FitzGerald 's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam ( `` There was a Door to which I found no Key / There was a Veil past which I could not see / Some little Talk awhile of Me and Thee / There seemed -- and then no more of Thee and Me .
